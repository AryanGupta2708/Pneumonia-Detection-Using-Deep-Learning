This notebook tackles pneumonia classification using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). In addition, this will also experiment with threshold values.
Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli. Typically, symptoms include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing.

Steps executed :


1. Process the images and resize them to the preferred size

2. Preparing the training and testing data

3. Visualize training images

4. incoprating the validation data into the training data

5. Prepare data for precision vs. recall and ROC

6. Set thresholds for our model

7. Plotting the confusion matrix

8. View some results from a sample of 25 images

9. Download the model
